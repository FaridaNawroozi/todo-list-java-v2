## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

As an aspiring Java developer, I wanted to practice writing clean and structured code.  
This project helped me understand:
- How to handle user input
- How to work with collections (like ArrayList)
- How to organize logic in a readable way

I'm currently improving my skills in Java EE, JSF, and agile development practices â€” and I'm looking forward to applying them in a real development team.
